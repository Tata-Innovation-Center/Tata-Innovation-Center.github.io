### Definition of a Matching Market
Given a set of players (buyers) $$X=[n]=\{1, \ldots, n\}$$ and a set of n items Y :
1. we associate with each player (buyer) $$i \in X$$, a valuation function $$v_{i}:Y \rightarrow N$$. For each $$y \in Y$$ , $$v_{i}(y) determines iâ€™s value for item y
2. we associate with each item $$y \in Y$$ , a price $$p(y) \in N$$
3. a buyer i who receives an item y gets utility
$$
v_{i}(y)-p(y)
$$
We would assume sellers get no utility.
