### Utility functions 

$$u_{i}(a_{1},a_{2})$$ denotes the utility player i get when player 1 playing $$a_{1}$$ and player 2 playing $$a_{2}$$

### Normal-form games
1. Players act only once;
2. Players act simultaneously
3. The number of players and the set of actions is finite

### Action profile

$$A = A_{1} × A_{2} × . . . × A_{n}$$ is a product of finite sets; we refer to $$A_{i}$$ as
the action space of player i, and refer to the product space, A, as the
outcome space.
