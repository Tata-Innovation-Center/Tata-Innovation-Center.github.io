### Definition of a Matching Market
Given a set of players (buyers) $$X=[n]=\{1, \ldots, n\}$$ and a set of n items Y :
1. we associate with each player (buyer) $$i \in X$$, a valuation function $$v_{i}:Y \rightarrow N$$. For each $$y \in Y$$ , $$v_{i}(y) determines iâ€™s value for item y
2. we associate with each item $$y \in Y$$ , a price $$p(y) \in N$$
3. a buyer i who receives an item y gets utility
$$
v_{i}(y)-p(y)
$$
We would assume sellers get no utility.

### Another definition
We refer to the tuple $$T = (n, Y, v)$$ (as defined above) as a
matching market, and the tuple $$(T, p) = (n, Y, v, p)$$ as a priced matching
market.

### Social Optimality of Market Clearing
We can define the social value of an assignment in a matching market
$$T$$ as
$$
S V^{\Gamma}(\alpha)=\sum_{i \in[n], \alpha(i) \neq \perp} v_{i}(\alpha(i))
$$
